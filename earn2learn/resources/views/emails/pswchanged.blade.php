      <h4>Eran to Learn account password changed</h4>

      Dear <?php echo $parent; ?>,
      <br>
      <br>
      Your password for the Earn to Learn account <?php echo $email; ?> was changed recently.
      <br>
      <br>
      If you didn't change your password recently, please contact us via email or phone.
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      Just a reminder:
      Never share your password with anyone.
      Create passwords that are hard to guess and don’t use personal information. Be sure to include uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.
      <br>
      Have a wonderful day.
